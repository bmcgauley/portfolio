## Recent Improvements (June 9, 2025)

### Text Contrast and Theme Consistency Fixed
- **Problem**: Dark text on dark backgrounds making content unreadable
- **Solution**: Systematically replaced all hardcoded color classes with theme-appropriate colors
- **Files Updated**:
  - `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Fixed all card backgrounds and text colors
  - `src/app/page.tsx` - Simplified homepage to use standard theme after Hero section
  - `src/components/FeaturedProjects.tsx` - Removed custom backgrounds, used theme colors
  - `src/components/RecentAchievements.tsx` - Updated text colors to theme colors

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Card Backgrounds**: Changed from `bg-white dark:bg-gray-800` to `bg-card text-card-foreground`
2. **Text Colors**: Replaced `text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400` with `text-foreground/70`
3. **Section Backgrounds**: Replaced custom gradients with `bg-background` for consistency
4. **Button Styling**: Updated call-to-action buttons to use proper theme colors
5. **Border Colors**: Changed from hardcoded grays to `border-border`

### Result:
