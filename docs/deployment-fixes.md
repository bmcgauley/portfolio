## Issue: Vercel Deployment Failing with Canvas Build Error

### Problem
Vercel deployment was failing with the following error:
```
npm error gyp ERR! build error 
npm error node-pre-gyp ERR! build error 
npm error Command "npm install" exited with 1
```

The error was caused by the `canvas` package trying to build native modules in Vercel's serverless environment, which lacks the necessary system dependencies.

### Root Cause
- `canvas` package was listed in `devDependencies` in `package.json`
- The package is only used in `scripts/create-placeholder.js` for generating placeholder images
- Vercel was attempting to install and build this native module during deployment

### Solution Applied

1. **Removed canvas from main package.json**
   - Removed `"canvas": "2.11.2"` from `devDependencies`
   - This prevents Vercel from trying to install the problematic native module

2. **Moved canvas to scripts directory**
   - Added canvas dependency to `scripts/package.json`
   - This allows local development use when needed

3. **Fixed CSS compatibility issues**
   - Converted TailwindCSS v4 syntax to v3 syntax in `globals.css`
   - Replaced `@import "tailwindcss"` with `@tailwind base;`, etc.
   - Replaced `@apply` directives with standard CSS

### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Removed canvas dependency
- `scripts/package.json` - Added canvas dependency for development
- `src/app/globals.css` - Fixed CSS syntax compatibility
- `TASK.md` - Documented fixes and added monitoring tasks

### Verification
- Local build test: ✅ PASSED
- ESLint check: ✅ PASSED (no warnings or errors)
- CSS validation: ✅ FIXED (no unknown at-rules)

### Next Steps
1. Test deployment on Vercel
2. Monitor for any additional issues
3. Verify all functionality works in production environment

### Additional Notes
- The placeholder image (`public/images/placeholders/site-preview-placeholder.jpg`) already exists, so the canvas script doesn't need to run during deployment
- Contact form gracefully handles missing email environment variables
- All core functionality should work without additional dependencies

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [x] Remove problematic native dependencies
- [x] Fix CSS compatibility issues
- [x] Verify local build passes
- [x] Run ESLint checks
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Verify production functionality
- [ ] Monitor for performance issues

## Environment Variables for Production

The following environment variables are optional but recommended for full functionality:
- `EMAIL_USER` - Gmail address for contact form
- `EMAIL_PASS` - Gmail app password for contact form

If not provided, contact form will gracefully degrade and log messages server-side.
